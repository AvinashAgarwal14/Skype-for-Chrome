This plugin will link phone numbers in web pages you visit, so that when you click them a call will be place with Skype, or any other application you configure to respond to a callto: URL.

* Currently only recognises US phone numbers, but the regular expression can be easily updated.
* On Linux, Chrome uses xdg-open to delegate external URL handling. I don't know how to make xdg-open recognise callto: links yet.

Installation
============

1. Clone the git repository
2. Open the Chrome extensions window (Menu -> Tools -> Extensions)
3. Click the + next to "Developer Mode" if it's not already expanded
4. Click "Load unpacked extension...", and choose the extension's directory on your drive

To Do
=====

* Recognize more phone numbers
* Figure out how to make xdg-open fire up skype
